# Lab 5 - Interrupts - "Remote Control Decoding"




Objectives

In this lab, you'll use your knowledge of interrupts and the Timer_A subsytem to reverse engineer a remote control. 

Details

The Basic Idea

You will need to use the timer interrupt and the general purpose pin interrupt to decode a remote control. Be sure to pick one remote for the whole lab, as remote codes vary. 

Lab day 1: learn the timing and bit patterns for your remote control

Lab day 2: demonstrate your code can receive and decode button presses from the remote control

Lab day 3: implement etch-a-sketch or pong

Prelab:

Question 1: it should be arround 65.536 msec

Question 2: It should be around 1ms per count

Pictures of prelab table are includes. Also, collected data included too.
